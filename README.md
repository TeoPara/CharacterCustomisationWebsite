## Hello!
This is the project for the _Character Customisation Website_.  
The purpose of the website is to allow players to view and customize their characters in their browsers!  
This uses Node.js and Socket.io

## How to run
You need Node.js v18.17.1, you can get the installer [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.17.1/) (choose either `..x64.msi` or `..x86.msi` depending on your system)  
After you've installed Node, run the command `node server.js`. This will start the server  

Once the server has been started, you can connect to port 3000. You can type `localhost:3000` or `127.0.0.1:3000` into your browser, and others can use your local IP if they're on the same Wifi network as you.
So if your local IP is `10.120.12.48` the address would be `10.120.12.48:3000`. [(how do I view my local IP?)](https://imgur.com/a/2AYX6kL)
